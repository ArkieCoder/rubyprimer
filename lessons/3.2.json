The `Array#each` method accepts a block to which each element of the array is passed in turn. You will find that `for` loops are hardly ever used in Ruby, and `Array#each` and its siblings are the de-facto standard. We'll go into the relative merits of using `each` over for loops a little later once you've had some time to get familiar with it. Let's look at an example that prints all the values in an array."
